allows you to switch between a poorly written shader and as best I could shader

Time Spent:
4-530
630-

Key Bindings:
  m   switch between bad and good shader
  r   refresh shaders (after editing file)
  arrows    change view angle
  pgdn/pgup    zoom
  0    reset view angle
  ESC    Exit

Results:
discard vs just set pixel to background color: 40 or more fps difference
function call vs inline really had no effect
overclock on/off: while on it was consistently +- 5 fps around 438, while off it peaked at 443 but was extremely variable and sometimes went to 330 fps (-100)
Unplugged: weirdly, while unplugging or plugging back in, the fps jumped to 500, then was chaotic for awhile before settling at around 5 fps lower than original
I couldn't really think of a good way to test float vs int since I need floats, but as you suggested int may be worse since graphics cards are made for floats
now I'm just going to make a really bad shader to see how much worse it can be
